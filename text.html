        <h1>Zen Garden Response</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What makes the Zen Garden interesting is that is shows off what anyone can do to a simple design using css. The archives display an amazing amount of creativity and eye for aestetics that designers can/should have to create appealing work in addition to knowing the tech side of the house. One thing I noticed as I looked through all of the designs is that it really showcases some elements of css at their best, but also, how they can be misued to create somethimg clunky or inaccessible.</li>
        <li>I didn't go through all 218 designs on the website, but one design that stood out to me right away was the Orchid Beauty by Kevin Addison. I absolutely loved the simplicity of it paired with the elegant images and use of shadow.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>And then I looked at the source code. I was shocked that the shadow was part of the two pictures and not a css effect. Using the image as a bullet for all the subheadings was also created by making each subheading an image already including the title. Which, if using the fancy font was super important, it would be best to use an image rather than rely on it be displayed that way by the browser. But I hope they did the back end part of it to make it accessible for screen readers.</li>
            <li>I looked more into the second column to see how they did it. They did use the aside function and used three divs to make them look like that. And, they subbed out the auto-generated bullet with an image that they labeled bullet even though it isn't a bullet. That's beside the bullet. See what I did there?</li>
